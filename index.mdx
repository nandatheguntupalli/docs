## What is the Operative SDK?

A small Python SDK that lets an LLM control a local browser to complete real-world tasks. One function, clear results, provider-agnostic.

## Show me the flow

1. Your app calls the SDK.
2. The SDK opens a local browser and streams screenshots.
3. The backend proxy coordinates steps with the model.
4. You get a `ComputerResult` with what happened.
